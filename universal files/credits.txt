
This pack is intended to be enabled ABOVE faithless in order to fix most mod issues and add a few mod texture support


there are some mods which can not be fixed with an overlay pack such as this and will need to modify the MAIN pack by deleting some files


----------------------------------------------------------

Some mods with known issues:

- DASHLOADER
Is known to sometimes cause audio to cut out, sometimes temporarily, sometimes entirely. 
The only solution is to disable this mod, or delete these files in the main pack:

Faithless\assets\minecraft\sounds.json
Faithless\assets\minecraft\sounds (entire folder)

----------------------------------------------------------

- CUSTOM ENTITY MODELS (aka CEM)
Is known to cause entities to break due to the mob models designed for Optifine's format
The only potential solution is to use this mod: 

Entity Texture Features: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-model-features

or delete these files in the main pack:

Faithless\assets\minecraft\optifine\ctm (entire folder)

----------------------------------------------------------

Not mod related, but a known issue with Optifine. 
If your game is lagging with CTM enabled and DYNAMIC LIGHTING, you will need to disable one or the other. 
There is no known solution otherwise.
